# Predicting_Aquatic_Toxicity_Feed_Forward_Neural_Networks
### Data Set Description
This dataset is used to solve a function approximation regression problem using keras feed
forward neural network models to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards the fish Pimephales
promelas (fathead minnow) on a set of 908 chemicals, to predict acute aquatic toxicity towards
Daphnia Magna. LC50 data, which is the concentration that causes death in 50% of test D.
magna over a test duration of 48 hours, was used as model response. The model comprised 8
molecular descriptors: TPSA(Tot) (Molecular properties) , SAacc (Molecular properties), H-050
(Atom-centred fragments), MLOGP (Molecular properties), RDCHI (Connectivity indices),
GATS1p (2D autocorrelations), nN (Constitutional indices), C-040 (Atom-centred fragments).

### Tasks : Comparing relative performance, computational effort changing number of nodes and hidden layers using Hyperparameter Tuning
